# When I enter "coca cola" and submit the form to add this product to my shopping cart,
# having typed raise params.inspect in #add method body,
# I see that my params hash with submitted form data looks like this:
# params = {
#   "utf8" => "âœ“",
#   "authenticity_token" => "a long string here==",
#   "product" => "coca cola",
#   "commit" => "add to cart",
#   "controller" => "products",
#   "action" => "add"
# }

# params has top-level key "product" that points to the string value of whatever user entered in form
