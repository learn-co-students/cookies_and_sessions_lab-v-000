<!--
Create views using the feature tests as your guide. The page should have,
at a minimum: a text box where the user can enter the name of a product,
a submit button that adds it to their cart, and a display of what's in the cart.
-->

<!-- new code start -->
<!--
<h1>Add Products</h1>
<%#= form_tag("/") do %>
  Product: <%#= text_field_tag "product" %><br>
  <%#= submit_tag "add to cart" %>
<% end %>
