# Cookies and Sessions

## Objective

We're going to make a very simple shopping cart, stored entirely in the session.

## Introduction

The Rails `session` method gives us access to the Rails session. The session is a datastore implemented with cookies. You can store simple data structures in the session. ActiveRecord models, no. Arrays of strings or numbers, yes. Basically, stick to data literalsâ€”numbers, strings, hashes, and arrays.

We're going to use this to implement a shopping site. Here's how the site will work:

  1. The page has an input box on it.
  2. The user types in the item they want and click `add to cart`.
  3. The item is added to their cart. The page shows everything in the user's cart.

## Instructions

1. Create the cart method in `ApplicationController#cart`.
2. Create a Products controller with two actions, index and add.
3. Create views using the feature tests as your guide. The page should have, at a minimum: a text box where the user can enter the name of a product, a submit button that adds it to their cart, and a display of what's in the cart.
